# Push_Swap
A sorting algorithm that takes as an argument the stack A formatted as a list of integers.

• The program must display the shortest sequence of instructions needed to sort stack
  A with the smallest number at the top.

• The goal is to sort the stack in ascending order with the lowest possible number of operations.

🧠Maximum amount of moves allowed with 5 numbers: 12,

🧠Maximum amount of moves allowed with 100 numbers for max score : 700,

🧠Maximum amount of moves allowed with \e[91m500 numbers for max score : 5500,

•MOVES ALLOWED:
sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a.
    Do nothing if there is only one element or none.

sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b.
    Do nothing if there is only one element or none.

ss : sa and sb at the same time.

pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a.
    Do nothing if b is empty.

pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b.
    Do nothing if a is empty.

ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1.
    The first element becomes the last one.

rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1.
    The first element becomes the last one.

rr : ra and rb at the same time.

rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1.
     The last element becomes the first one.

rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1.
     The last element becomes the first one.

rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.
